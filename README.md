A Sprint Retrospective Management Software

SprintRetro

What?

SprintRetro is a service to manage Sprint Retrospectives or Sprint Reflections in the Scrum Agile Software Development Framework.
 
Why?
 
A traditional session has shortcomings:

-It is hard to provide anonymous feedback
-Bandwagon effect
-Time constraints

How?

-SprintRetro allows anonymous feedback.
-Does not show metrics while the team is assessing feedback to prevent the bandwagon effect.
-Key points are provided ahead of time by the Scrum Master and Team.
-The Team can vote and provide feedback on key points ahead of time.
-The SprintRetro becomes a meeting to assess the feedback instead of gathering it
